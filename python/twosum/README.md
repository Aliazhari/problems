Given an array of integers, return __indices__ of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target\.

You may assume that each input would have __*exactly*__ one solution, and you may not use the *same* element twice\.

__Example:__

Given nums = \[2, 7, 11, 15\], target = 9,

Because nums\[__0__\] \+ nums\[__1__\] = 2 \+ 7 = 9,

return \[__0__, __1__\]\.
